    "**The rewards the stock market brings to investors who know how to read it right are enormous while its penalties can be grievous to those who are ignorant, careless or unlucky. Nevertheless, investors are faced with the problem of knowing the right stock to buy and when to buy it. As a result, two different methods have been provided to address these problems. They are Fundamental analysis and Technical analysis.\n",
    "The fundamental analysis method involves examining auditor’s reports, balance sheets, profit and loss statements, dividend records, companies’ policies, and so on to determine what stock is worth buying or selling.\n",
    "The technical analysis method involves visualisation (mostly graphical representation) of the stocks trading history like price changes, volume of transaction, etc to determine the trend of the stocks and then making predictions on the future of the stocks based on insights drawn from the visualisation.\n",
    "The method to be used in this project is Technical Analysis.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Statement**\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Being able to tell what stock to buy and when to buy it is quite a challenge for investors as buying the right stock at the wrong time can lead to great loss and buying at the right time can yield great reward.\n",
    "In order to help investors make the right decisions, we start by taking a technical analysis of the stock market where we check historical performances and patterns of the stock and then make accurate deductions on how the stock will perform in the future. This will then help investors make informed decisions.This will be achieved using python and several machine learning models for predictions.**"

Trading volume is a measure of how much of a given financial asset has traded in a period of time. For stocks, volume is measured in the number of shares traded and, for futures and options, it is based on how many contracts have changed hands, While the same shares may be traded back and forth multiple times, the volume is counted on each transaction. **High Volume: Generally good stocks have high volume, which reduces liquidity risk. More people are trading these stocks indicate more people want them in their portfolio**"

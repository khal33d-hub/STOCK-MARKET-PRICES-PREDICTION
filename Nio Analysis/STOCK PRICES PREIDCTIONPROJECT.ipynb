    "The rewards and wins for the stock market brings to investors who can interpret the market are quite enormous while its penalties can be grievous to those who are ignorant, careless or unlucky. Nevertheless, investors are faced with the problem of knowing the right stock to buy and when to buy it. As a result, two different methods have been provided to address these problems. They are Fundamental analysis and Technical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental analysis method involves examining auditor’s reports, balance sheets, profit and loss statements, dividend records, companies’ policies, and so on to determine what stock is worth buying or selling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The technical analysis method involves visualisation (mostly graphical representation) of the stocks trading history like price changes, volume of transaction, etc to determine the trend of the stocks and then making predictions on the future of the stocks based on insights drawn from the Exploratory Data Analysis and visualisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We employed a Technical Analysis Method for this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Problem statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to tell what stock to buy and when to buy it is quite a challenge for investors as buying the right stock at the wrong time can lead to great loss and buying at the right time can yield great reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for prospective investors make the right decisions there is a need to have an informed decision around the subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "we started  by considering a technical analysis of the stock market, historical performances and patterns of the stock where also considered and then make accurate deductions on how the stock will perform in the future. This will then help investors make informed decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be achieved by devising an efficient algorithm using Recurrent Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM)\n"
